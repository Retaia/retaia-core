# Runtime Audit (`specs@b6eb044`)

Date: 2026-03-28
Spec baseline: `specs/api/openapi/v1.yaml` from `retaia-docs@b6eb0447cf3c9d3bf3d4b9d2969ceda4cd38202a`

## Findings

### P3. Several runtime services still combine domain orchestration with infrastructure details in the same class

- Representative locations:
  - [`src/Workflow/Service/BatchWorkflowService.php:192`](/Users/fullfrontend/Jobs/A%20-%20Full%20Front-End/retaia-workspace/retaia-core/src/Workflow/Service/BatchWorkflowService.php:192)
  - [`src/Command/IngestEnqueueStableCommand.php:103`](/Users/fullfrontend/Jobs/A%20-%20Full%20Front-End/retaia-workspace/retaia-core/src/Command/IngestEnqueueStableCommand.php:103)
- Impact:
  - business rules, SQL access and side-effect coordination remain interleaved
  - these classes are harder to reason about, mock cleanly or replace piecemeal
  - the codebase keeps growing around “god services” instead of stable domain/infrastructure seams
- Why this is below the target quality bar:
  - the core pattern should be: application service/use case orchestrates, repositories/gateways persist, lower-level adapters handle transport or filesystem concerns

## Recommended remediation order

### Batch 1: continue decomposing remaining god services

- keep reducing SQL / side-effect coordination inside `BatchWorkflowService`
- split operational command-side logic in `IngestEnqueueStableCommand` into narrower collaborators
